# Multivariate-Gaussian-Processes-for-Signal-Interpolation-and-Source-Location-Estimation

Gaussian processes have enjoyed much popularity in the past few decades owing to their unique formulation. We extended their applicability in complex data by proposing a multivariate Gaussian approach to solving GPs for complex variables. Communication signals and sampled space-time field being complex data and the nature of the noise being i.i.d Gaussian, we applied the developed method to the signal interpolation problem successfully. Such an approach accounts for the correlation between the real and imaginary part of the data. We showed that such a formulation can be applied readily to complex data interpolation problems such as the signal interpolation problem and empirically showed the improvements achieved over previously used penalized least squares  methods. The draft summarizing our initial results was submitted to Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters (AWPL) and was readily accepted and published. Since then, we have extrapolated our research to a generalized multivariate approach to finding inferences for complex variables.
